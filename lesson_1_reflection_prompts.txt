HOW TO USE GIT AND GITHUB

NEW COMMAND: Comparing old and new files with $diff

	diff -u game_old.js game_new.js
	
	- The ones with minus existed in the previous version but not in the new version
	+ The ones with plus sign were added in the new version
	
NEW COMMAND: For printing the current directory path

	PWD <-- that's it, it's all you haz to type
	
	
COURSE QUESTION: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	The diff command prints out the differences between two file nicely and you can check the added and removed
	lines of code for any peculiarities. Wherever there was a + or a - sign I checked the code and it was clear
	that the word "space" was misspelled. 
	
COURSE QUESTION: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	Well, it would make flipping between old and new versions much easier. You could easily go back to a point where everything worked and such. 
	
COURSE QUESTION: How often should one commit

	One commit per logical change. 

COURSE QUESTION: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	PROS: 
		- your commits can be order in a logical way, 
		- you get to choose when to commit
	
	CONS: 
		- you can miss out and not save anything

COURSE QUESTION: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	GIT allows saving multiple files because these files interact and depend upon eachother. 
	Google docs saves files seperatly because they are not meant to have any relationships between them.

COURSE QUESTION: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	$git log --stat ------> shows you how many lines were added/deleted in all the commits
	$git diff first_id second_id ------> show difference between two specific commits

COURSE QUESTION: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Well, using GIT, I will always be able to return to the previous working version when building something new an potentially risky. 

COURSE QUESTION: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	
	I'm gonna be a heavy GIT user from now on. I need it especially for my new project.
