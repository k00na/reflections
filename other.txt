MY FIRST MERGE CONFLICT

$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

        both modified:   game.js

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

what does all this mean? 

QUESTIONS THAT ARISE: 
					- what is a merge conflict?
					- what are unmerged paths?
					- what does it mean if a my origin/master branch is ahead by 1 commit?
					
Merge conflict:
