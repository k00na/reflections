COURSE QUESTION: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because you want to know what you're pulling from GIT. You can't let anything just jump into your repository. 
	
COURSE QUESTION: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	FORKS vs CLONES: to fork a repository means to make a clone of it on your github account. 
			 if you want this forked repository on your computer, you have to clone it. 

	CLONES vs BRANCHES: clone represents a whole repository, a branch represents only that one branch of the repository.

	FORKS vs BRANCHES: two utterly different things
